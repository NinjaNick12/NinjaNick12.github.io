Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
Lab 4
I really liked this lab because it was simple but very useful. It showed how to use basic math in programming to solve real-world problems, like converting measurements. It was fun to see how the program could take one input, like "100 ml," and give clear results for all the other units. The lab also taught me how important it is to organize the output so it's easy to read. Overall, it was a fun and practical way to learn coding concepts.

Lab 6
I liked this lab because it taught me how to make programs more reliable and user-friendly. It was helpful to see how input validation can prevent errors and give clear instructions to the user when something goes wrong. This is an important skill because programs often need to handle mistakes or unexpected inputs. Overall, it was a simple but useful lab that showed how to make programs work smoothly.

Lab 10
This lab is great because it shows useful programming concepts in a simple and practical way. It includes two functions that work with county data stored in a 2D vector. The first function, AllCountiesString, loops through the counties, pulls out their names, and combines them into one string. The second function, CountyPopulation, searches for a specific county and returns its population. The code is easy to follow, with clear comments explaining each step. It teaches important skills like looping, searching, and working with strings and numbers. The clean and readable code makes it perfect for beginners learning C++.
